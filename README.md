### Project Overview

Despite having an absolute nightmare during this assignment, having some personal stuff that prevented me from submittin on time. 
I initially excepted that I'd have to skip this one but that red 'missing' label on the Grades page just taunts me every time I see it. So better late than never. <br>
My overview of Bootstrap is that I can imagine it is a great skill to have, I'll certainly be practicing further, but my personal preference would have to stay with having much cleaner HTML without all the classes.
